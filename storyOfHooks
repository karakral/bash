sometimes, we want to run some scripts ( task ) before or after commits or before or after pushing, and etc. We can config this for pre-push and etc. 
Enjoy the Bash script.
  
0- cd .git/hooks
1-  add the bash script top of the pre commit.sample file
#!/bin/sh
# to check if run hooks in the project or not after, run we can comment it
echo "ðŸš€ Pre-push hook triggered!"
# Name of the branch to block
BLOCKED_BRANCH="testhook"

# Get the current branch name
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "$BLOCKED_BRANCH" ]; then
    echo "ðŸš« Pushing from the branch '$BLOCKED_BRANCH' is not allowed."
    exit 1
fi

# Allow push for other branches
exit 0
2- mv pre-commit-sample pre-commit
3- chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
